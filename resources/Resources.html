    <p>There are lots of brilliant resources out there on the Internet but, <br>
        some of them are just too hard to find, some of them are non-vanilla and some of them are just not safe for work so, <br>
        I've selected a few sources that I like to use and that's a loved by the community and others</p>
    <h2 class="twinkl"><a href="https://www.twinkl.co.uk/">twinkl</a></h2> 
    <a class="twinkllogo"><img src="/photos/twinkl logo.png" alt="twinkllogo"></a>
    <p>
        The reason I like twinkle over other learning resources is because they've got way more unique resources <br>
        to put it in better words they've got thousands of colouring pages activity books and so much more <br>
        but you can get even more with a subscription and <br>
        that doesn't even cost too much but you also get a 30 day trial when you join the site
